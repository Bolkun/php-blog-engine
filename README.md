# bolkun
Nowadays there are a lot of CMS written in php. During my research I could not find the perfect one, 
which will cover all my needs. This project is simple coded and easy understood with minimum knowledge of
programming languages. It has only features, which really useful and needed by the customer. 
That's why a great attention was paid for performance, speed and security. Easy to install, 
minimum changes by configuration and that's it!
